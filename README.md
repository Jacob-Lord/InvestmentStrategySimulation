## Description of the program

This program is intended to simulate a stock market investment strategy over 5 years. With an initial amount of $1000 in a saving account with 0.5% interest per month and the initial stock price at $100, the investment strategy is to buy stock if its price drops below $95 or sell the stock if its price increases above $110. This program will generate 60 random variables with a uniform distribution U(0,1) in order to simulate this scenario for 60 months (5 years). The stochastic model for the stock price is: next month the price will remain the same has probability 1/2, probability 1/4 that it is 5% lower, and probability 1/4 that it is 5% higher. 

It is assumed that there are no transaction costs to buy or sell stock.
